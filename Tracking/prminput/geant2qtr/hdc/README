PROGRAM : coord2hits.pl
DESCRIPTION : coord2hits.pl takes as its input a file which contains three sets of coordinates, and outputs a file which may be used as the input for QTR to perform R2 track reconstruction.  The first two points in the event correspond to a track in Region 2, and are used to calculate the line parameters.  The third point is the hit position on the upstream plane of the Cerenkov bar.  coord2hits.pl parses the data to determine the hit wires in the HDC and the corresponding hit positions for each wire hit.  The output file is then generated containing all the HDC events.  It adheres to some rules for the data reading of the Qevent class, and builds the proper structure for each event and each hit within the event.

USAGE : >./coord2hits.pl -i<input data file> -o<output data file>

NOTES : 
  - The Geant 3 Qweak simulation uses a different coordinate system than the standard Qweak lab frame.
