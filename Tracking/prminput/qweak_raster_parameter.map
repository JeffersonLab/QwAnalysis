!
! These are the outputs measured by VQWK when raster is homed, units: Volts

! These are the averaged channel numbers (pedestal) for position measured by V792
! when the raster is homed, units: channel

! name of chanel, pedestal, gain
! if this is a Triumf ADC enter the hardware sum pedestal
! the pedestal will be subtracted to the data
