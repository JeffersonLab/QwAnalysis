R 0.862 1.4 2 # maxslope was calculated for only the x-direction, but is applied to u and v.  u and v max slopes should be smaller.  maxroad will need to be studied to determine what the optimal value should be.  Hermes used 1.4  MaxXRoad determines how close u,v,x tracks have to be, and will need to be optimized.
