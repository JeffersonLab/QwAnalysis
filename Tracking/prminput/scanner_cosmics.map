! Created by J. Pan, for the focal plane scanner
! This file needs to be modified according to actual modules and
! channels assigned to scanner detector. We need two channels of
! QADC's for monitoring the PMT gain, 3 channels of TRIUMF ADC's
! for measuring the X, Y position of the scanner, and one scaler
! channel for the coincident rate.
