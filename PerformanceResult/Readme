  1) turn off "debug flag"

  2) remove ROOTGLIB into CXXFLAGS
     in evio, and QwAnalysis Makefile

  3) change optimization flag
     -02, -0s, -03 with and without -mtune=prescott flag

     -mtune option is only for the i386 and x86-64 family of computers

     Because test machines supports MMX, SSE, SSE2, and SSE3 instruction set
     (See fags in individual machine logs), I use this option to improve 
     their perform aces.

  4) test results are in "perform.dat"

     cpu(MHz) :   cpu MHz
     KiB      :   cache size (KiB)
     #        :   how many cpus
     0        :   trunk 
     2        :   -02, with no debug
     2p       :   -02 -mtune=prescott, without debug option
     sp       :   -0s -mtune=prescott, without debug option
     3p       :   -03 -mtune=prescott, without debug option

     (make, qwparity) : time make, time qwparity -r 5260 


  5) i386 machine, the optimal compiler option is "-02 -mtune=prescott".
     x86_64, such options is "-02 -mtune=nocona".
     But, the minimal option on both i386 and x86_64 is "-02".
