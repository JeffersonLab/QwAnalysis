!
!  The ramp gain is given by the 0.3 V full-scale range of the ramp
!  signal
!  (360 degrees * 76.29 mV/VQWKbit / 0.3 V)===(0.091548 degree/VQWKbit)
!  A fit against FGX1 and FGX2 were done of the form:
!       "[0] + [1]*sin(TMath::DegToRad()*[2]*x + [3])"
!  to determine a scaling term.
!  
!  Modifed based on Don's finding in Elog 1027.
!
!  gain_new = (0.0876389) * 360./(Don's range)
!  ped_new  = -109.0046 - (Don's offset)/gain_new
!
!  For run range 13842-14675, these are
!       Don's offset:   3.89
!       Don's range:  357.53
