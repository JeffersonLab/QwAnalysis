! 12-07-2010  B.Waidyawansa  Created from qweak_beamline_geometry.map
!
!
! 02-28-2011  B.Waidyawansa  Added rotation status. There are three options:
!			   	'rotation=xx' where xx is some angle in degrees (no spaces).
!				'unrotated' this will se the rotation angle to zero.
!				 no keyword in the column indicates using the default rotation angle of 45 degrees.
!			     By default, all the bpms are assumed to be rotated clockwise around Z+ (beam direction) by 45 degrees w.r.t. X axis.
!  			     Added the AlphaX, AlphaY and BSEN factors obtained from EPICS.
!
! Description of variables:
!-----------------------------
! X/Yoffset - The difference in the ideal position and the surveyed position of a BPM in X/Y axis.
!
! Z offset  - The location of the BPM in the injector beamline. Need to fill this.
!             to the center of the device/ origin of device coordinate system.

! BSEN scaling factor - Bpm SENsitivity scaling factor is the ratio of general BSEN = 18.81 adc counts/mm 
!                       seen in most of the BPMs in the hall and the actual BSEN of a BPM. 
!                       The first set of bpms in the injector beamline have a BSEN = 13.7. So their BSE factor = 13.7/18.81 ~ 0.7283
!                       So we use this factor to apply such changes.
!
! AlphaX/Y  - Relative gains of the individual XM,YM pairs compared to XP,YP pairs for the BPMs
!            - X and Y ADC counts to mm conversion factors for the QPD (counts/mm).
! 
! The units of the offsets are in millemeters to be comparable with the units of the analysis results.
!
!
! For BPMs that don't have factors or offsets given in the list below, default values will
! be assigned. 
!   default  offset (X/Y/Z) = 0.0
!   default BSEN scaling factor = 18.81
!   default AlphaX/AlphaY = 1.0

! device type, device_name,   Xoffset, Yoffset,  Zoffset, BSEN factor,  AlpaX,    AlpaY,         rotation
