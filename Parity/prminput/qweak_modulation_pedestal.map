!
!  The ramp gain is given by the 0.3 V full-scale range of the ramp
!  signal
!  (360 degrees * 76.29 mV/VQWKbit / 0.3 V)===(0.091548 degree/VQWKbit)
!  A fit against FGX1 and FGX2 were done of the form:
!       "[0] + [1]*sin(TMath::DegToRad()*[2]*x + [3])"
!  to determine a scaling term.
!  For run 9636, the scaling term was 0.9573.
!
!  The ramp pedestal is taken from run 9636, such that the average of
!  the ramp-on period corresponds to 180 degrees.
!  With this definition, the "FG on but not active" period seems to
!  be a reasonable way to determine the ramp pedestal as well.
