!This file contains beamline event cut properties

!IMPORTANT
!---------
!Make sure when puting tabs in the map file entries, always put ", " before inserting a tab. 
!Otherwise the routine QwParameterFile::GetNextToken(", ") will extract the entry with the tab character.

!Comments
!--------
!Devices that are not in the list are not subjected event cut checks
!All devices  will be tested for HW checks.
!
!For device_type =bcm only upper and lower limit of the calibrated charge on the ADC HW sum. (QwVQWK_Channel::fHardwareBlockSum)
