    <h1>Programmer's Guide to ``Pan''</h1>

    <hr />

<p>``Pan'' is the Parity Analysis code for HAPPEX II and related
experiments at Jefferson Lab.  It is being developed and maintained by

<a href="http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes">Richard Holmes</a>,

<a href="http://www.jlab.org/~rom">Robert Michaels</a>,

<a href="http://www.jlab.org/~moffit/">Bryan Moffit</a>,

<a href="http://www.jlab.org/~paschke/">Kent Paschke</a>,

Riad Suleiman,

and

<a href="http://www.jlab.org/~vacheret">Antonin Vacheret</a>,

with contributions from additional authors.  This design document
contains a description of requirements, programming rules, an overall
description of the program, a list of classes and their
responsibilities, program flow, and a UML conceptual class
diagram.</p>

    <h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>

    <p>The code must meet the following requirements.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Based on <a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a>.</li>

      <li>Analysis of one run and its constituent miniruns.
	  A minirun is usually associated with
      feedback or with short-term diagnostics.</li>

      <li>Allow choice of analysis : asymmetries from normal running,
      pedestal and DAC calibrations, 
      beam-only data, etc.</li>

      <li>Inputs that define the conditions of analysis, e.g. Run type
      definition, Cuts, Datamap, DAC noise parameters, Feedback Options
      can come either from a simple interface (e.g. text file), or from
      a database.</li>

      <li>It should be easy to change or add devices, datamap, cuts,
      and other setup quantities.</li>

      <li>Analysis can run as a interactive ROOT session, or batch
      mode.</li>

      <li>Separate ROOT macros will make plots for diagnostics and perform
	  post-analyzer tasks such as regression and modulation analysis.
	  </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>PROGRAMMING RULES</h2>

    <p>Code developers will try to conform to the the following
    programming rules.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>All objects' constructors initialize their members in a valid
      state.</li>

      <li>Unexpected usage or results must be conveyed unambiguously.
      Either return a clear error flag or print a warning to stdout.
      E.g. if you try to <code>event.GetData("typo","error")</code> you get a
      warning.</li>

      <li>Copy constructors and assignment operators must always be
      defined. If you don't intend a user to copy or assign objects of
      your class, declare them private with no implementation. Don't
      accept the compiler's default.</li>

      <li>If the preferred constructor takes arguments, define a
      default constructor with no arguments as protected since it's
      required by derived classes.</li>

      <li>Define a virtual destructor unless nobody will ever derive
      from this class.</li>

      <li>Never pass an object by pointer as an argument. Only pass by
      reference. If the class will not change the object being passed,
      pass as a const reference. If passed as a non-const ref, it's
      assumed the argument may (and probably will) be changed.
      (Some exceptions have been made: for some methods that take a
<span class="classname">string</span> argument, an equivalent method
taking a <span class="classname">char*</span> argument is provided for
use from CINT, which has trouble playing nicely with STL classes.)</li>
	  
      <li>Similarly, methods may not return pointers to objects.  (For
some methods that return a <span class="classname">string</span>
value, an equivalent method returning a

	  <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TString.html" class="classname">TString</a>

	  -- <em>not</em> a <span
class="classname">char*</span> -- is provided.)</li>

      <li>If a method does not change the state of a class it should be
      declared const, e.g. <code>bool IsEpicsEvent() const;</code>. Absence of
      <code>const</code> implies the state of the object may (and probably will)
      be changed by this method.</li>

      <li>Header files should only contain the header files of super
      classes or standard library. All other classes may be forward
      declared like <code>class TaEvent;</code>. This makes makefile dependencies
      and maintenance simpler.</li>

      <li>Modified Taligent conventions; the modification is to have a
      small ``a'' (means Hall A) after T or V at the start of concrete
      and abstract class repectively. E.g <a href="html/TaCutList.html" class="classname">TaCutList</a> or
<a href="html/VaAnalysis.html" class="classname">VaAnalysis</a>.  Ordinary data member identifiers begin with f
and an uppercase letter, and static data members begin with fg and an
uppercase letter, e.g. <code>static deque&lt;TaEvent&gt; fgEventQueue;
TaEvent fEvLeft</code>.

    </ul>

    <a href="comments.html">commenting recommendations.</a>

    <h2>OVERALL DESCRIPTION</h2>

    <p>``Pan'' can refer to the C++ analysis software generally or to one specific application built from that software.</p>

    
    <p>The Pan application is a relatively simple application,
appropriate to the straightforward nature of the analysis.  When
invoked with -f, -r, or -o command line options it finds a single run
in a data file or in online data, finds the analysis control database entries
corresponding to that run, and analyzes that run.  Statistics are
printed periodically, and a ROOT file containing processed data and
analysis results as well as a results database file are created.  Pan
is compiled with ROOT allowing it to be used another way: when invoked
with no -f or -r option a ROOT prompt is presented.  Pan's classes are
then available for use from the ROOT prompt or in ROOT macros.</p>

    <p>Also built from the Pan classes are Panam, a GUI driven
analyzer intended mainly for online monitoring, and libpan.a, a
library containing the more generally useful Pan classes for use by
other applications.</p>

    
    <h2>CLASS RESPONSIBILITIES</h2> 

    <p>The most important classes of the analyzer are described here.
    We explain in words the responsiblity of the class.  Classes are listed in
    a semi-logical order from "big" to "little".  For details see the
    <a href="html/USER_Index.html">Pan Class
    Index</a>, or follow the class name links to the

<a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/THtml.html"
class="classname">THtml</a>-generated

    class documentation.  (Panam classes need to be added to this.)

	  initializes the event <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TTree.html" class="classname">TTree</a>, attaches the Coda file or

      <dd>
	  <p> Abstract base class of analysis. Derived classes include

	  <a href="html/TaStandardAna.html" class="classname">TaStandardAna</a>
	  (for standard physics analysis),

	  <a href="html/TaFeedbackAna.html" class="classname">TaFeedbackAna</a>
	  (for feedback-only analysis),

	  <a href="html/TaADCCalib.html" class="classname">TaADCCalib</a>
	  (for computation of pedestals and
	  DAC noise slopes), and

	  <a href="html/TaDebugAna.html" class="classname">TaDebugAna</a>
	  (for debugging helicity signal problems, etc.; actually derives from

	  <a href="html/TaStandardAna.html" class="classname">TaStandardAna</a>).

	  Other specialized analyses, if needed, can be developed as
	  new derived classes.
	  Each of these is responsible for some
	  treatment of VaEvents from a TaRun.  The type of analysis to
	  be done is specified in the analysis control database, and the

	  <a href="html/TaAnalysisManager.html" class="classname">TaAnalysisManager</a>

	  instantiates the
	  appropriate analysis class accordingly.</p>

	  <p><a href="html/VaAnalysis.html" class="classname">VaAnalysis</a> has
	  initialization and termination routines for both the overall
	  analysis and the analysis of a particular run.  At present
	  Pan is designed to analyze only a single run, but these
	  routines provide for a possible future version that will
	  handle multiple runs.</p>

	  <p>The main event loop is inside the <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:ProcessRun" class="methname">ProcessRun</a> method.  The three main
	  methods called from here are <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:PreProcessEvt" class="methname">PreProcessEvt</a>, <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:ProcessEvt" class="methname">ProcessEvt</a>, and <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:ProcessPair" class="methname">ProcessPair</a>.  The first of these places the
	  most recently read event into a delay queue until the
	  delayed helicity information for that event becomes
	  available.  Cut conditions are checked for here.  Once the helicity
	  information is added the event is pushed onto a second delay queue,
	  while the events are used to construct pairs which are pushed onto a
	  third delay queue.  These two delay queues are used to hold
events and pairs until we can tell whether they fall within a cut
interval caused by a cut condition arising later.  Events and pairs
which emerge from the ends of these queues are analyzed in <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:ProcessEvt" class="methname">ProcessEvt</a> and <a href="html/VaAnalysis.html#VaAnalysis:ProcessPair" class="methname">ProcessPair</a>, respectively.  Analysis results
are added to the events and pairs themselves.

	  <a href="html/TaPairFromPair.html" class="classname">TaPairFromPair</a>

	  for analysis of data with HAPPEX-I style pair-oriented helicity structure, and

	  <a href="html/TaPairFromQuad.html" class="classname">TaPairFromQuad</a>

	  for analysis of data with G0 style quadruple-oriented
	  helicity structure.  (Note that no Pan structure corresponds
	  to a quadruple; the only differences between these two
	  classes are the checks they make on helicity structure.)</p>

	  <a href="html/TaPairFromPair.html#TaPairFromPair:Fill" class="methname">Fill</a> takes a <a href="html/TaEvent.html" class="classname">TaEvent</a> object and, if it can't use
	  it immediately to create a pair, stores it in a static
	  container and returns <code>false</code>; if it can pair it
	  with a previously stored event, it fills the pair with those
	  two events and returns <code>true</code>.  Methods are
	  provided to compute differences and asymmetries for a given
	  device.</p>
