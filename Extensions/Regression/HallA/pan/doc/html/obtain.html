    <h1>How to obtain <span class="shoutcolor">Pan</span></h1>

<p>Pan is available for installation on your system.  It has been
developed under Red Hat Linux, currently is known to work on RHEL 3
and Scientific Linux 3 (probably still works on Red Hat versions 7.3
and later), and has been used successfully under Debian Linux as well.
Let us know if you need to use it under a different system and we'll
do what we can to help you get there.</p>

<p>You can obtain Pan in either of two ways:</p>

<ol>

  <li class="spaced">Most users will want to download the current
  production version
      in the form of a tar file, available at

      <a href="http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/happex/pan/pan_v1.1.tar.gz">&lt;http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/happex/pan/pan_v1.1.tar.gz&gt;</a>

      After downloading, unpack with

      <blockquote><code>tar -xvzf pan_v1.1.tar.gz</code></blockquote>

      This will create a directory called <code>pan</code> containing all source,
      macro, and documentation files, and default configuration files.</li>
      
  <li class="spaced">Experts or would-be experts may want to get the
  latest version
  of Pan from the CVS repository.  (For example, you may need or
  want a version that fixes a bug in the current production
  version, or adds a feature.  But note that bugs may have been
  added too!  The CVS version has not necessarily been tested for
  stability.)  Anyone with a Jlab account can
  check out Pan in read-only mode.  On whatever computer system
  you want to install Pan on, first make sure you have CVS installed.
  (See
  
  <a href="doc/CVS_howto">CVS_howto</a>

  and
  
  <a href="http://www.cvshome.org">&lt;http://www.cvshome.org&gt;</a>
  
  for information on obtaining and using CVS.)  Then check out Pan
  using (in sh type shells)
      
      <blockquote><code>export CVS_RSH=ssh<br /> 
      cvs -d ":ext:<em>user</em>@cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/parity/cvs" checkout pan</code>
      </blockquote>
      
or (in csh type shells)
      
      <blockquote><code>setenv CVS_RSH ssh<br /> 
      cvs -d ":ext:<em>user</em>@cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/parity/cvs" checkout pan</code>
      </blockquote>

      where <em><code>user</code></em> is your Jlab user name; normally you will
      need to type your Jlab password when prompted.  This will create
      a directory called <code>pan</code> containing all source,
      macro, and documentation files, and default configuration files.
      If you want write access to the CVS repository (i.e., if you
      want to become a contributing Pan author) you must contact

      <a href="mailto:rom@jlab.org">Bob Michaels, &lt;rom@jlab.org&gt;</a>.

</li>
