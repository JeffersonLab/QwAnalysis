   
   How to use CVS
   ==============

This is a quick "crib sheet" on CVS usage for Pan users.  For more
details, general information, instructions on obtaining and installing
CVS, etc., see <http://www.cvshome.org>.

Please use the "ext" access method instead of "pserver", with ssh as 
the login protocol.  The old "pserver" method used clear text passwords
which is a security hazard and should be avoided.  If you have used 
"pserver" before, delete ~/.cvspass which contains the the poorly-encrypted 
password.

In your local login script (.cshrc, .bash_profile), delete any definition 
of CVSROOT.  You do not need to set CVSROOT explicitly; it will be stored 
locally in the checked-out directory tree and only needs to be given once 
at checkout time (see below).

In the login script, define CVS_RSH as follows:

For bash:
% export CVS_RSH=ssh

For csh/tcsh:
% setenv CVS_RSH ssh

You are basically done. To check out the repository, do

% cvs -d ":ext:user@cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/parity/cvs" checkout pan

Of course, replace "user" in the above command with your CUE username.
You can now use CVS as usual.  The argument of the -d option gets
stored in the CVS ROOT file; you can override it in your subsequent
CVS commands with a -d argument to the command, but you shouldn't have
to.

You will notice that you now have to enter your password for every
CVS command that requires access to the server.  This is inconvenient,
but can be avoided if you set up ssh keys.  Doing so is a bit involved.
Instructions can be found at

   http://hallaweb.jlab.org/computing/ssh-keys.html

Note that login1.jlab.org and login2.jlab.org do not accept ssh keys,
but the CVS server, cvs.jlab.org, does.  

Anyone with a CUE account may read the repository. However, only a
limited set of users have write access. If you want to contribute and
need full access, please contact Bob Michaels.

For more on CVS usage, see the free CVS book at www.cvshome.org, and I have
a copy too, at:

  http://www.jlab.org/~rom/cvsbook.ps.gz

Examples of CVS commands for username = rsholmes:

* Checking out a working copy 
    cvs -d ":ext:rsholmes@cvs.jlab.org:/group/halla/parity/cvs" checkout pan

* Looking for differences in repository
   cvs diff

* Obtaining updates from the respository
   cvs update

* Committing a change
   cvs commit -m "correct path to codaclass" Makefile

An obscure problem with CVS (in case it happens again)

Once I could not do a "cvs checkout", got error message 
   "cvs server: failed to create lock directory "
It couldn't create #cvs.lock in a particular directory.
I went to that directory on /group/halla/parity/cvs/pan,
saw no such file, and tried this:
   touch #cvs.lock
   chmod 775 #cvs.lock

Then checkout got a different error message.  Next I did
   rm #cvs.lock
 
... finally the checkout worked !
