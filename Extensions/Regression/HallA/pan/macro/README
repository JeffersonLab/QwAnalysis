This file: README for "pan" plotting macros

I. Contents  (this will evolve over time)
===========

asy.macro      -- fits the BCM asymmetries
beam1.macro    -- crude example
bg_beamcurrent.macro  -- part of the "bplot" package
bg_helcorr.macro      --   ditto
bg_help.macro         --   ditto
bg_rawsignal.macro    --   ditto
bg_tree_define.macro  -- part of bplot package
bgraph1.macro   -- crude example
bgraph2.macro   -- crude example
bplot.macro     -- driver for bplot package
bpmdiff.macro   -- fits bpm diffs.  User is asked which bpm.
open.macro      -- opens a root file.
pan_asym.macro  -- charge asymmetry plots
pan_diff.macro  -- position difference plots

II. Usage
=========

    Macros exist as *.macro in directory ./macro

    To analyze a run, open its root file, and give a sample plot: 
        '.x run.macro'
        and answer which run number

    To open a file:  '.x open.macro'
        and answer which run number

    To plot and fit the BCM asymmetries
        '.x asy.macro'

    To plot and fit the BPM differences
        '.x bpmdiff.macro'

    To plot lots of different things (raw signals, asymmetries, etc)
        '.x bplot.macro'  (this also calls open.macro)

    To plot all types of charge asymetry plots
        '.x pan_asym.macro' (this asks for run number and opens that
        file)

    To plot all types of bpm diffs plots
        '.x pan_diff.macro' (this asks for run number and opens that
        file)
