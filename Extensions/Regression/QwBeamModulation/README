Makefile has now been modified to provide support for both local and jlab machines:

To compile on an ifarm machine use:

make

If you are on a personal machine and do not want to invoke the msql libraries(this will cause compilation errors if you try to compile code that needs mysql++) use:

make runMpsOnly NO_MYSQL=-D__NO_MYSQL

or 

make runMpsOnly NO_MYSQL

"Makefile_full" is the original Makefile to compile QwModulation as well as 
QwMpsOnly.

Makefile_full includes database connection "stuff" that is not useful at UVA 
where much of the development is going on so a new simple Makefile has replaced
the larger more extensive one. The Makefile here only compiles the QwMpsOnly.cc
class and the main program, qwmpsonly.cc

In order to have a working version at either UVA or JLab, you will need to set 
some environment variables. 

    $MPS_ONLY_ROOTFILES
    $SLUGLET_FILES
    $BMOD_SRC  this must be the location of the config directory, containing setup_mpsonly.config
      	       (probably we should make this more flexible sometime)
    $BMOD_OUT: this must have the following directory structure: 

       output/slopes
       output/macrocycle_slopes
       output/coil_sensitivities
       output/regression
       output/diagnostics
       output/rootfiles

Build that structure and have $BMOD_OUT point to output/

The following is an example of the command line options that might be used:

runMpsOnly --run 12079 --file-stem mps_only --set-stem set0 --ramp-pedestal 10 --phase-config config/phase_set0.config --ramp-max-nonlin 3 --chi-square-min 1 --2Dfit 1 --transverse-data 0  --set-output $BMOD_OUT --setup-config $BMOD_SRC/config/setup_mpsonly.config --use-data-tertile 0 --omit-coil -1 --set-low-ramp-bound 50

In order to perform multiple analyses with different conditions, it is desireable 
to specify the output directory so as not to overwrite existing data. I recommend 
setting up a bmod_out directory with the subdirectories shown above for each 
separate analysis. My convention is to append the same string to each component of
the analysis process as follows:
  1. choose an identifying name like "_10Coil"
  2. append this name to the output directory i.e. "bmod_out_10Coil/" and to the
     configuration file used in the analysis "config/setup_mpsonly_10Coil.config".
     These can be specified using the flags shown above i.e. --set-output and
     --setup-config. The default values for these are shown in the above example.
  3. Append the same name to any further files associated with this analysis
     such as database friend trees and beam modulation slopes trees.

To run the mps only code and find residuals use the script findBModResiduals.sh.
Be sure to set the variables properly for your given analysis job.
