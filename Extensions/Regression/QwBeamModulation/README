Makefile has now been modified to provide support for both local and jlab machines:

To compile on an ifarm machine use:

make

If you are on a personal machine and do not want to invoke the msql libraries(this will cause compilation errors if you try to compile code that needs mysql++) use:

make runMpsOnly NO_MYSQL=-D__NO_MYSQL

or 

make runMpsOnly NO_MYSQL

"Makefile_full" is the original Makefile to compile QwModulation as well as 
QwMpsOnly.

Makefile_full includes database connection "stuff" that is not useful at UVA 
where much of the development is going on so a new simple Makefile has replaced
the larger more extensive one. The Makefile here only compiles the QwMpsOnly.cc
class and the main program, qwmpsonly.cc

In order to have a working version at either UVA or JLab, you will need to set 
two environment variables. 

    $MPS_ONLY_ROOTFILES
    $SLUGLET_FILES
    $BMOD_SRC  this must be the location of the config directory, containing setup_mpsonly.config
      	       (probably we should make this more flexible sometime)
    $BMOD_OUT: this must have the following directory structure: 

       output/slopes
       output/regression
       output/diagnostics
       output/rootfiles

Build that structure and have $BMOD_OUT point to output/

The following is an example of the command line options that might be used:

runMpsOnly --run 12079 --file-stem mps_only --set-stem set4 --ramp-pedestal 10 --phase-config config/phase_set4.config --ramp-max-nonlin 50
