The macros in this directory are useful for plotting certain BMOD outputs and 
residuals. 

checkInvertedSlopes.C
Reads the inverted slopes from the "slopes/slope<run_number>.set4.dat" files and
uses them to correct the data in the bmod_only rootfiles. It then profiles the 
data and fits a sine + cosine curve to the corrected data vs. ramp_filled. These
residual cosine and sine components are stored in the 
"slopes/run<run_number>Cosine(Sine)Ampl.dat" files.

checkInvertSlopes.sh
Script that executes "runQwMpsOnly.cc" and then "checkInvertedSlopes.C" for a 
given run range creating the modulation slopes and diagnostic files and residual 
cosine and sine amplitude files.

plotInvertedSlopesBySlug.C
Plots the inverted slopes (dDet/dMon) as found in the 
"slopes/slope_<run_number>.set4.dat" files. These slopes are error weighted and 
averaged over full slugs. This program gets its runlist by slug from the file 
"runBySlug.dat" also located in this macros directory.

plotResidualCosAndSinCompBySlug.C
Plots the residual cosine and sine amplitudes vs slug.

plotMonitorOrDetectorSlopes.C
Plots either the monitor or detector coefficients (dMon/dCoil) vs slug.
