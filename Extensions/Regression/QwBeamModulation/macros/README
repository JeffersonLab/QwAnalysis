The macros in this directory are useful for plotting certain BMOD outputs and 
residuals.

checkInvertedSlopes.C (Out of date. This file is not useful in the current scheme 
                       since it uses one slope per run whereas our current 
                       analysis has one slope per macrocycle. Use 
	               findBModResiduals.C or findBModResidualsFast.C instead.)
Reads the inverted slopes from the "slopes/slope<run_number>.set4.dat" files and
uses them to correct the data in the bmod_only rootfiles. It then profiles the 
data and fits a sine + cosine curve to the corrected data vs. ramp_filled. These
residual cosine and sine components are stored in the 
"slopes/run<run_number>Cosine(Sine)Ampl.dat" files.

findBModResiduals.C ("Out of date"ish. findBModResidualsFast.C uses TGraph's 
	             findBmodResiduals.C uses either TProfile's or TGraph's 
	             produced with the Draw() command both of which have their own
                     set of issues. TProfile's are plagued with small statistics
                     bins and TGraph's created with the Draw() command can have 
	             binning issues)
Reads the inverted slopes from the "macrocycle_slopes/macrocycle_slopes*.dat" 
files and uses them to correct the data in the bmod_only rootfiles. It then 
profiles the data or plots it as a TGraph using the Draw() command and fits an
A + B*sine + C*cosine curve to the corrected data vs. ramp_filled. These residual 
cosine and sine components are stored in the 
"macrocycle_slopes/run<run_number>Cosine(Sine)Ampl_*.dat" files.

findBModResidualsFast.C (Current)
Reads the inverted slopes from the "macrocycle_slopes/macrocycle_slopes*.dat" 
files and uses them to correct the data in the bmod_only rootfiles. It then plots 
it as a TGraph and fits an A + B*sine + C*cosine curve to the corrected data vs. 
ramp_filled. These residual cosine and sine components are stored in the 
"macrocycle_slopes/run<run_number>Cosine(Sine)Ampl_*.dat" files.

makeReducedRunletAverages.C(Out of date. Crashes due to memory issues.)
makeRegressedRunletAverages.C(Out of date. Crashes due to memory issues.)
makeCorrecedRunletAverages.C (Out of date. Crashes due to memory issues.)
These three programs create text files of runlet averages of quartet data for the
reduced, regressed and dither-corrected slugfiles respectively. They have been
replaced by MakeRunletAverages.C

makeRunletAverages.C(Curent)
Creates text files of runlet averages of quartet data for the reduced, regressed 
and dither-corrected slugfiles.

plotInvertedSlopesBySlug.C
Plots the inverted slopes (dDet/dMon) as found in the 
"slopes/slope_<run_number>.set4.dat" files. These slopes are error weighted and 
averaged over full slugs. This program gets its runlist by slug from the file 
"runBySlug.dat" also located in this macros directory.

plotResidualCosAndSinCompBySlug.C
Plots the residual cosine and sine amplitudes vs slug.

plotMonitorOrDetectorSlopes.C
Plots either the monitor or detector coefficients (dMon/dCoil) vs slug.



Scripts
*************************************
      
checkInvertSlopes.sh (Out of date. See explanation for checkInvertedSlopes.C.)
Script that executes "runQwMpsOnly.cc" and then "checkInvertedSlopes.C" for a 
given run range creating the modulation slopes and diagnostic files and residual 
cosine and sine amplitude files.

findBModResiduals.sh (Current)
First runs $BMOD_SRC/runMpsOnly.cc to create the BMod slopes and coefficients 
files and then runs findBModResiduals.C to create residuals. It takes in a run
range as its two arguments. 
  OVERWRITE_SLOPESFILES can be set to 0 if you only want to create slopes files 
                        that do not already exist. This will still try recreate 
                        all residual files.
  NEW_MONITORS can be set if you wish to use the new composite monitor set
  SINE_ONLY creates slopes from only the sine amplitudes (5 coil modulation). In 
            general, this should be set to 0.
  TRANSVERSE flag is used when analysing tranversely polarized data.
  NONLINCUT is used if you wish to cut half of the BMod data that creates the 
            largerst excursions in targetX and targetY before finding slopes. This
            should be set to 0 unless doing a specific study.
  CHISQUARE set this to 1 if you wish to used 10 Coil modulation with Chi Square
            minimization.
  PHASESET chose set number for phase offset used in 5 coil modulation. Eg. if you
           set this to 4 the runMpsOnly.cc will use phase_set4.config for its 
           phase offsets.  

findBModResidualsFast.sh (Current)
Exactly the same as findBModResiduals.sh except that instead of trying to find all
runs in the given run range it only tries to run the program for runs that have
mps_only files.Furthermore, it takes NEW_MONITORS as a second argument. 
The outut of ls mps_only_*.root is used to create a list of run numbers to 
analyse. It is called "Fast" because it does not try every run but first assembles
a runlist of exist runs and goes over it.

findBModResiduals2.sh (Current)
Same as findBModResiduals.sh except that it takes a runlist from a file. The run-
lists are stored in files called files$1.txt, where $1 is the number you pass as
the first argument to the script. The second argument is an optional beginning 
run number if you wish to skip some at the beginning of the file. This is useful
if you want two processes running at the same time over different portions of the
same runlist file.

text files.
