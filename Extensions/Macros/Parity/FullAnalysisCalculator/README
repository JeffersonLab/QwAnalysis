This program is designed to extract the asymmetries and correction information from a input text file and to produce an output file containing the corrected asymmetries. For more information see https://qweak.jlab.org/wiki/index.php/Full_Analysis_Calculator.

Input - A text file containing the columns regressed asymmetry, polarization, backgrounds, dilutions and their respective errors. Rows represents the selected time periods (slugs/Wiens/variable)
Output - A text file containing rows of corrected asymmetry, individual corrections and the errors for the selected time periods.


Source code:
================
fullanacalc.cc - main file.
QwReadWrite - Contains the classes used to decode read/write tethe input/output text files containing data.
QwCalculator - Contains the methods to calculate the unblinded physics asymmetry. This basically is a modular form of the program, compute_LH2_asym.cc, that was used to apply the corrections on the Wien0 data set.
