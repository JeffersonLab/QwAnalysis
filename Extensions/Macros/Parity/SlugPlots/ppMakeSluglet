# STEM = rootfilestem of the ROOTfiles generated by qwparity that will be used in the generation of the Sluglet ROOTfile
# SUFFIX = rootfile suffix of the ROOTfiles generated by qwparity. examples are "trees" "histos" and "" with the latter being valid for files with no suffix.
#
# Note that all TString arguments must have their double quotes preserved. Hence the escaped quotation marks \"
