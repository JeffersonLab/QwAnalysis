<center><h2>Q2 Plots and Values</h2></center>
<center><p> 
This plot is the one that is output by the Q2 script. The left column is the sacttering angle and the right 
is the Q^2 values.  The rows form top to bottom are both packages, package 1, and then package 2. 
The mean values and the error are given in the text file below the plot.

<a name="Chi"></a>
<center><h2>Log(Chi) plots and values</h2></center>
<center><p> 
The first two plots are the log(Chi) for each plane in region 1 and 2 respectivly.  
From left to right the layout is such that, there is the total package (in black), the X plane (in red),
the U plane (in blue) and the V plane (in green) of the package which is being ploted.
Below these plots is a text file that has the mean Chi value for all of these and the error.  
The direction is refenced by number where 0 == total package, 1 == X plane, 3 == U plane, and 4 == V plane.  <br>

<!-- 
<center><p> The third plot log(Chi) values vs time in in region 2 for package 1 (across the top and package 2 across the bottom.
From left to right the order is total package, X plane, U plane, V plane.</p><center>
<p><center><img src="Chi_%%RUNNUM%%__chi_vs_time.png"></center></p>

<a name="Residual"></a>
<center><h2>Residual value - Region 2</h2></center>
<center><p>
The first two plots here are for package 1 and package 2 respecitvly, for all 12 planes going 1-6 across the top and 7 -12 across the bottom.
The planes are color coordinated such that the Xplane is red, the U plane is blue and the V plane is green.  
The third plot is the residual for all the planes in package 1 (left) and package 2 (right)
Below this is a text file that has the mean residual and the error for all the packages, 
where 0 is all the plane and 1 -12 is the number of the plane. <br>
Please note: the rediual is calulated by:fQwTreeLines.fQwHits,fDriftPosition-fQwTreeLines.fQwHits.fTrackPosition, 
and the residual in the Root tree is the absolute value of that

<center><p>
These last plots is the Mean Residual value vs. Plane number in Region 2 for 
pacakge 1 (left) and 2 (right).  The error bars without the horzantal ticks at the end are    
just the RMS values of the plot, and the ones with the ticks are the error defined as 
RMS/sqrt(N).

<a name="hdc"></a>
<center><h2>Horizontal Drift Chamber Plots</h2></center>
<center><p>
These plots graph the drift time and drift distance in region 2 for each plane of wires, x,u,v.  
The left graph is package 1 and the right is package 2.  
In both the drift distance is across the top and the drift time is across the bottom.
Again plane X is red, plane U is blue and plane V is green.

<a name="QwHits"></a>
<center><h2>QwHits plots</h2></center>
<center><p>
The first plot is the QwHits in each region, where 0 == null, 1 == Region 1, 2 == Region 2, 
3 == Region 3, 4 == Trigger Scintillator, 5 == scanner, and 6 == numRegions.
The second plot is the QwHits in each package, where 0 == null, 1 == package up, 2 == package down, and 3 == numPackages.
The third plot is the QwHits in each direction, where 0 == Null, 1 == Direction X
2 == Direction Y, 3 == Direction U, 4 == Direction V, 5 == Direction R, 
6 == Direction phi, 7 == Direction Left, 8 == Direction Right, and 9 == numDirections.

<center><h2>Octant Determination Plots</h2></center>
<center><p>
The first two plots graph the main detector signal vs. the trigger scintillator for package 1 
(left) and then package 2 (right) for each octant (where it would be on the farris wheel) with

<center><p>
The next four plots graph the main detector signal for region 2 (top) and then region 3 (bottom) for both package 1
(left) and then package 2 (right) for each octant (where it would be on the farris wheel) with
the octant that was passed to through the analyzer graphed itn the center.
