<center><p> 
This plot is the one that is output by the Q2 script. The left column is the sacttering angle and the right 
is the Q^2 values.  The rows form top to bottom are both packages, package 1, and then package 2. 
The mean values and the error are given in the text file below the plot.

<center><h2>Q2 vs. X and Y Beam Position Plots</h2></center>
<center><p>
All plots illustrate Q2 vs. beam position for x and y position (global) of the rastered beam.
The top plot is for x beam position and the bottom plot is for y beam position, for both packages,
package 1, and package 2, respectively. The dependence between Q2 and beam position has been
figured in each of them. The slope, error, and chi square are given in the text file below
the plots.

<a name="Chi"></a>
<center><h2>Log(Chi) plots and values</h2></center>
<center><p> 
The first two plots are the log(Chi) for each plane in region 1 and 2 respectivly.  
From left to right the layout is such that, there is the total package (in black), the X plane (in red),
the U plane (in blue) and the V plane (in green) of the package which is being ploted.
Below these plots is a text file that has the mean Chi value for all of these and the error.  
The direction is refenced by number where 0 == total package, 1 == X plane, 3 == U plane, and 4 == V plane.  <br>

<a name="Residual"></a>
<center><h2>Residual value - Region 2</h2></center>
<center><p>
The first two plots here are for package 1 and package 2 respecitvly, for all 12 planes going 1-6 across the top and 7 -12 across the bottom.
The planes are color coordinated such that the Xplane is red, the U plane is blue and the V plane is green.  
The third plot is the residual for all the planes in package 1 (left) and package 2 (right)
Below this is a text file that has the mean residual and the error for all the packages, 
where 0 is all the plane and 1 -12 is the number of the plane. <br>
Please note: the rediual is calulated by:fQwTreeLines.fQwHits,fDriftPosition-fQwTreeLines.fQwHits.fTrackPosition, 
and the residual in the Root tree is the absolute value of that

These last plots is the Mean Residual value vs. Plane number in Region 2 for 
pacakge 1 (left) and 2 (right).  The error bars without the horzantal ticks at the end are    
just the RMS values of the plot, and the ones with the ticks are the error defined as 
RMS/sqrt(N).

<center><p>
These plots graph the drift time and drift distance in region 2 for each plane of wires, x,u,v.  
The left graph is package 1 and the right is package 2.  
In both the drift distance is across the top and the drift time is across the bottom.
Again plane X is red, plane U is blue and plane V is green.

<a name="R3TreelinesMatchUp"></a>
<center><h2>R3 match up of the treelines</h2></center>
<center><p>
These plots are to investigate how well the treelines in each plane match up with each other.
They are of the slope and the Chi^2 values of ALL (no cuts as of 04-15-2014) the treelines 
in the file.  This is done for the treelines, partial tracks, and tracks.  The fist group of
plots are for the slope and the second set are for the Chi^2 values.</p>

<p>How are the planes related to each other you ask?   Well that is a very useful question.
The planes are: Both, U, V, UU and VV.  In the plots we have:


<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" style="width:300px">
<tr>
  <td>Plane</td>
  <td>VDC</td>    
  <td>notes</td>

<center><h3>Slopes</h3></center>
<center><p>
The first set of plots is the treelines.  The first 3 are both VDCs together, 
the front VDC and then the Back VDC for package 1 and likewise for package 2.
Both VDCs include the UU and VV plane from left to right.  The front and back 
VDCs have both planes combined, the U and then the V plane.
This is followed by a text file with average slopes in it.
