Welcome!

There has been additions to the process to analyze a run for the tracking data.
This file is to help with question that one might have in regards to the additions.

You will see that the large difference in this directory is that there are config
files. These are so that one can test the modifications they are making to an
autoplot script in there local directory and use the qwroot that was used
for the pass itself. This is a wonderful way to test scripts with less stress.

The main drive behind this is that one can now update or not if they want their
local QwAnalysis directory, and it doesn't have to be at the same revision number
as the rootfile you are analyzing, if it is one used to generate the webpage.

These files include/define the following variables, or can not with commenting
them out with a squashed spider, #:
QWANALYSIS - there analyze directory for the pass one is looking at
  this is the QwAnalysis directory with the qwroot version for the
  pass, the one you want to use. (this will probably not be commented out)
WEBDIR - this is the directory of the webpage for the pass. If you are testing
  a script and you want to not have it go to the website and go somewhere say
  locally then comment this out, and use the standard one as defined in the
  process_run file or you can define a different one here locally (not likely to
  get commented out)
QW_ROOTFILES - this is the directory of the root files for the pass on the
  cache disk (this will probably never be commented out) you will still have
  to jcache the files if there are not there.
QWEXTENSIONS - This is the directory to where the Extensions directory is with
  the autoplot(s) script that one is testing. This is commented out by default,
  as it will most likely be your local directory (Make sure to run QWAnalysis,
  which we all do anyway:
    setenv QWANALYSIS ~/QwAnalysis
  so that QWEXTENSIONS is defined right away to your local directory).

Q: How do I use this?

A: Great question!  Here is how.

  Make sure that you have set up the QWANALYSIS variable to your local one.
  Most of use do this by habit or default, so not a problem.
  You will not have to do the other commands that we have had to in the past.

  When running process_run, you will do something like the following (modify for
  your needs)
    ./process_run.sh --run=<runnum> --marco=<macro> --configfile=<configfileofpass>

  to just regenerate the front page, it will be
    ./process_run.sh --run=<runnum> --index --configfile=<configfileofpass>

For the people who are in charge of submitting the whole pass or just a run the form
to do this is:
  ./submit_run.sh --run=<runnum> --configfile=<configfileofpass> --pass=<pass>


*Please note:*
  Using this with autoplots scripts pre-r5979 this will not work,
  rather you will get a bunch or errors. My apologies I had to change
  the prefix.

I think that is all. Hope this helps.

Good Day!
