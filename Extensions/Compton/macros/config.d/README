The files in this directory define which macros are run during the 
post-processing stages of the analysis.  The files are 
prioritized configuration files that point to the macros to execute.

Active files in this directory should have the format NNname.conf, where 
NN is a number that determines which macro is run first, name indicates 
what the macros is, and .conf is the mandatory extension.

To temporarily disable a macro, simply create an empty file with identical
name as the configuration file, but with extension .conf.disable. For
example: NNname.conf.disable

The content of the file configuration files looks like this:

  name=Asymmetries of Accumulator 0
  macro=accum0/accum0.C
  function=accum0
  directory=ComptonPhotonAccum0
  includesdir=accum0
  compile=kTRUE

- The name field provides more information on the macro.
- The macro field gives the location of the macro to load, located under 
$QWANALYSIS/Extensions/Macros/Compton.
- The function field specifies the name of the function to call in the 
loaded macro.
- The directory field is unused.
- The includesdir field specifies which other directories in 
$QWANALYSIS/Extensions/Macros/Compton should be crawled for include 
files (e.g. if you have #include "cutOnLaser.C", and that file is 
located in the 'foobar' directory, then you should add that here).  
The directory 'shared' is automatically added.
- The compile field specifies whether the macro should be compiled.  
Support for interpreted macros will be removed, so this should always be 
kTRUE.
