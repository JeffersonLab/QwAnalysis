How the script determines data quality:

By default, all queries select production data only. Good data is selected by
the following conditions:

runlet.runlet_quality_id = 1
FIND_IN_SET('1',runlet.good_for_id)
FIND_IN_SET('3',runlet.good_for_id)

Previously, I had cut on run.good_for_id and run.run_quality. There is an
ongoing discussion about what we should consider good data. This section will
be updated after an official opinion is formed.

How the script determines target:

Target defaults to LH2, but any target can be specified.
