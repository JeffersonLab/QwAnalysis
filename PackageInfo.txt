 \section overview Overview of the Qweak data analysis package

    \subsection doxycontent Information about the doxygen documentation

    This is doxygen generated documentation for the qweak analysis
    software package. General information about the analysis package
    as a whole should be added here, by the people who are actually
    writing the code. The file that generates this overview is called
    "PackageInfo.txt" and can be found in the '$QWANALYSIS'
    directory. Specific documentation about the code, should be added
    as comments to the source code, as required by doxygen. The
    doxygen configuration file can be found in the same directory and
    should be edited to incorporate additional documentation features,
    if needed. In addition to the usual source code extensions, the
    file is currently edited to include all documented "*.txt", "*.in", 
    and "*.map" files in the directories starting with and downstream 
    of '$QWANALYSIS'.
